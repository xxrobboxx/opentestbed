## Introduction ##
Bots for the Meerkat-API always come with a `*`.pd-file. If this wiki-page gets outdated be sure to check the /data-directory to find all available bots.

## `DemoBot/AlwaysCallBot` ##
Not a real enemy to anyone - but a good measure to see how much your bot can gain when playing against a very very veryyyy predictable bot.<br>
If you loose against this one, you made something pretty wrong<br>
<br>
<h2><code>DemoBot/SimpleBot</code></h2>
The one embedded with the Meerkat API. It got some slight improvements (for instance being able to play No-Limit).<br>
This bot has hard-coded preflop-logic. After the flop it decides based on pot-odds and win-odds.<br>
Even though simple, its able to beat the default XenBot from Poker Academy by a good margin (>25bb/100). Unfortunately it loses against the Sklansky-2-Bot (which in turn loses against Xenbot). Thhis shows how important it is to test against different types of bots, to find one most robust against all other strategies.<br>
<br>
<h2><code>MCTSBot/MCTSBot</code></h2>
A bot doing Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search to decide upon its actions.<br>
You can read about the bot in the following paper <a href='http://pokerai.org/pf3/viewtopic.php?f=64&t=2664'>http://pokerai.org/pf3/viewtopic.php?f=64&amp;t=2664</a>.<br>
This bot originates from the CSPoker project (<a href='http://code.google.com/p/cspoker/'>http://code.google.com/p/cspoker/</a>) and with the knowledge of its authors was ported to the Meerkat-API.<br>
<br>
Be aware, that this 'bot' is not just a bot - its rather a very good framework for doing MCTS-Research. You can plugin different strategies - how is the tree built, how are nodes evaluated, how are nodes chosen ... a huge amount of possibilities available already - and waiting for you to tune existing or create new ones.<br>
<br>
Be sure to check out the MCTSMeerkatBot-class and play around with all the different possible strategies ! Also always remember: the more time this bots has to 'think' the more it converges to a good playing strategy.<br>
Also don't forget to activate the debug-GUI in the meerkat-file, when you are debugging - MCTSBot will show you it's own GUI of the whole decision tree then.<br>
<br>
<h2><code>FlockBot and Chumpbot</code></h2>
Don't forget that there are other Meerkat-Bots around ...<br>
