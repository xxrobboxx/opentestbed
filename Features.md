# Meerkat Api #
  * full suport for agents written against the meerkat API

# Run different game types #
  * Cashgame Limit/No-Limit with automatic Rebuy
  * (todo) Tournament

# Import data to your favourite Tracker #
  * You can import results of your bots into PokerTracker and Hold'em Manager

# Reduce Variance #
  * replay games with same cards but changed seatorder
  * (todo) DIVAT analysis

# Get a graph of game results instantly #
  * The bigger your simulations get, the longer it takes to import the data into a tracker.
> Wouldn't it be nice to see a graph with the results right after the simulation finished ?

> As you can see our bots are not the fastest (one bot is allowed to 'think' 1000ms) in the example. Anyway - at least we know that we can go to sleep as the simulation will only be ready the next morning. The bankroll graph and time estimates are updated every 10 seconds.

> If you run the same hands with multiple seat permutations the results of one hand are grouped by the way! So the more seat-permutations are simulated the smoother your graph will be.

> The final chart of the simulation is not static by the way - you can zoom in and out, change the size and save it at any resultion you like dynamically (the chart is also saved in a standard resolution automatically).
